h1. CakePHP Fixturize Shell

A CakePHP shell to create a fixture using the values of any given database table so one does not have to type it up manually.

h3. Installing

1. Copy fixturize.php to vendors/shells (or app/vendors/shells)<br>
2. That's it!

h2. Usage / Docs

To create a fixture for your posts table, run the following in your Terminal:
<pre><code>
cd cake/console
./cake fixturize post
</code></pre>

This will create a file called app/tests/fixtures/post_fixture.php for you holding all records of that table.

If you want to fixturize more than one table at a time, simply provide more table names as space separated arguments.

In case you previously fixturized a table already, use the --force option to overwrite the old one.
